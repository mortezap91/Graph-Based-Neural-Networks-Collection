# Graph-Based-Neural-Networks-Collection

This repository contains implementations of three advanced neural network architectures using PyTorch, focusing on graph-based data processing. Each work demonstrates a different approach to handling graph data. Below are brief overviews and instructions for each.


1. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):
   
This work implements a basic Graph Convolutional Network using PyTorch. GCNs are designed to process data structured as graphs, making them suitable for tasks such as node classification and link prediction.

Key Features:

1-1. Simple two-layer GCN architecture
1-2. Customizable hidden dimensions and dropout rates
1-3. Example of using synthetic data for training and testing

2. SrCycleGan:

This work focuses on implementing a CycleGAN for image-to-image translation tasks. CycleGANs are effective for tasks where paired training data is not available.

Key Features:
2-1. Implementation of the CycleGAN architecture
2-2. Training loop with example datasets
2-3. Instructions for running on GPU

3. Graph Convolutional on Tensorflow:

This notebook demonstrates how to use TensorFlow for creating a graph convolutional model. It builds on the concepts of GCNs but leverages TensorFlow's capabilities.

Key Features:
3-1. TensorFlow-based GCN implementation
3-2. Examples using TensorFlow datasets
3-3. Visualization of graph data and model performance
